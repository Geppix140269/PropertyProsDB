# 🚀 Multilingual Supplier Registration Platform

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW (STATIC)

### What We're Building
A professional, bilingual (English/Italian) supplier registration platform with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **CMS**: Sanity for translations and taxonomy
- **Deployment**: GitHub → Netlify (auto-deploy)
- **Design Philosophy**: Warm, professional, trustworthy - not cold/aseptic

### Core Features
1. **Multilingual Support** (EN/IT)
   - Dynamic route-based language switching (`/en/`, `/it/`)
   - All UI text stored in Sanity CMS
   - Form validation messages in both languages

2. **Supplier Registration Form**
   - Multi-step form with progress indicator
   - Real-time validation
   - File uploads for documents
   - Dynamic category/subcategory selection
   - Data saved to Supabase

3. **Content Management**
   - Categories (hierarchical)
   - Regions (with tax validation rules)
   - All UI translations
   - Managed through Sanity Studio

### Key Requirements
- ✅ NO local development - everything via GitHub
- ✅ Auto-deploy to Netlify on push
- ✅ Beautiful, warm, professional design
- ✅ Path comments at the beginning of EVERY file
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Fully responsive design
- ⚠️ NEVER edit parts of files - ALWAYS provide COMPLETE files
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO apostrophes in code - use &apos; or backticks
- ⚠️ CHECK for special characters that break deployment:
  - No straight apostrophes (') in JSX text
  - No unescaped quotes in strings
  - Use HTML entities: &apos; &quot; &amp; &lt; &gt;
  - Or use template literals with backticks
